		<h2>Recap of Last Race</h2>
		<h3><span style="color:red">Bristol Motor Speedway</span></h3>
	
				<p>In the closest finish ever at Bristol, Harvick won for the eighth time at the track and the fifth time in six starts since joining Stewart-Haas Racing. 
				Harvick collected his 32nd career victory, nine of which have come since 2013.Harvick, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Austin Dillon stayed out on old tires during the caution, but Edwards led a parade to pit road for fresh 						rubber, and by the time the front of the field cleared Turn 2 on the restart lap, Edwards had moved into second place.As the cars sped through the final two corners on the last lap, Edwards nudged Harvick's No. 4 						Chevrolet and dived to the inside. Twice their cars collided in the final quarter-mile, with Harvick winning the drag race to the finish. Harvick after the race said: </p>

							<q>That was not the car that I wanted to see behind me. I knew I could beat him down there, and I tried to protect the bottom in (Turns) 3 and 4 and I just missed the bottom with all the rubber build-up on the 							tires and everything.
							But, all in all, I knew I was going to be on defense down there. I got up too high and wasn't able to stay on the bottom like I wanted to, and then he got into me, like he should have, and I needed to get a 								good run off the corner, and I was going to have to get into his door and it worked out -- just barely.</q>

						NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race of the season by .010 seconds (roughly four inches), 
						the identical margin by which Denny Hamlin had beaten Martin Truex Jr. in the season-opening Daytona 500.</p>
